# ViveShare Prototypes
Copyright (c) 2017, HTC Corporation. All rights reserved.

## Introduction:

- In this project, we provide serveral prototypes demonstrating "ViveShare" experience, which is a kind of shared experience between Vive Player and co-located audience. The audience can be mere viewers, or can actively collaborate/interact with Vive player.


- We encourage developers to create such "shared" experience, which can transform passive audience into active participants of VR universe.

## Hardware requirements:

For a "ViveShare" experience, you need the following hardware:

 - Vive
 - Smartphone (in these prototypes we support Android 6.0 or above)
 - One Vive tracker per smartphone 
   (for ver 1.0.0, we only support 1 mobile player; multiplayer support is planned)
 - Wireless LAN environment for your PC and smartphones

## How to run pre-build examples

1. Bind trackers to certain TrackerRole (see Vive Input Utility documentation)
2. Install the APK file to your smartphones
3. Make sure all smartphones can connect to the PC hosting Vive via Wireless LAN
   (you can get diagnostic tools from Google Play store)
4. Enjoy the ViveShare experience!

## Software Requirements:

To build the prototypes from Unity Editor, please get these plugins from Unity Asset Store:

 - SteamVR plugin (ver 1.2.1 or newer)
 - Vive Input Utility (ver 1.6.0 or newer)
